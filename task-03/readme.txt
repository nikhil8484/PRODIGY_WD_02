Project Name: Tic-Tac-Toe Web application



discription :
To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check 
for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe
game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each
other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win 
the game.

Explanation:

HTML: Defines the structure of the game board using <div> elements 
for cells, a status message to display whose turn it is or if the game is 
won/drawn, and a reset button.

CSS: Styles the game board and its elements to create a visually 
appealing interface with hover effects on cells and a clean layout.

JavaScript: Manages the game logic with functions for handling clicks
 (handleClick), checking win conditions (checkWin), checking for a
 draw (checkDraw), and resetting the game (resetGame). It updates the board state, updates
  the UI accordingly, and determines the game's 
  outcome based on player moves.


  How to Use:
  Click on any empty cell to place your marker (X or O).
  The game will switch turns between players.
  The status message updates to indicate whose turn it is or if someone has won.
  When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the status message reflects the outcome.
  Click "Reset Game" to start a new game.
